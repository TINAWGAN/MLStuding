## Normalization, Reshape and Label Encoding 
* Normalization
    * We perform a grayscale normalization to reduce the effect of illumination's differences.
    * If we perform normalization, CNN works faster.
* Reshape
    * Train and test images (28 x 28) 
    * We reshape all data to 28x28x1 3D matrices.
    * Keras needs an extra dimension in the end which correspond to channels. Our images are gray scaled so it use only one channel. 
* Label Encoding  
    * Encode labels to one hot vectors 
        * 2 => [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
        * 4 => [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]
# Normalize the data
X_train = X_train / 255.0
test = test / 255.0
print("x_train shape: ",X_train.shape) # x_train shape:  (42000, 784)
print("test shape: ",test.shape)     #test shape:  (28000, 784)

# Reshape
X_train = X_train.values.reshape(-1,28,28,1)
test = test.values.reshape(-1,28,28,1)
print("x_train shape: ",X_train.shape) # x_train shape:  (42000, 28, 28, 1)
print("test shape: ",test.shape) # test shape:  (28000, 28, 28, 1)

# Label Encoding 
from keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical # convert to one-hot-encoding
Y_train = to_categorical(Y_train, num_classes = 10)





# Train/Test split
# Split the train and the validation set for the fitting

X_train, X_val, Y_train, Y_val = train_test_split(X_train, Y_train, test_size = 0.1, random_state=2)

### What is Convolution Operation?
* We have some image and feature detector(3*3)
* Feature detector does not need to be 3 by 3 matrix. It can be 5 by 5 or 7 by 7.
* Feature detector = kernel = filter
* Feauture detector detects features like edges or convex shapes. Example, if out input is dog, feature detector can detect features like ear or tail of the dog.
* feature map = conv(input image, feature detector). Element wise multiplication of matrices.
* feature map = convolved feature
* Stride = navigating in input image.
* We reduce the size of image. This is important bc code runs faster. However, we lost information. 
* We create multiple feature maps bc we use multiple feature detectors(filters).
* Lets look at gimp. Edge detect: [0,10,0],[10,-4,10],[0,10,0]
* After having convolution layer we use ReLU to break up linearity. Increase nonlinearity. Because images are non linear.

### Same Padding
* As we keep applying conv layers, the size of the volume will decrease faster than we would like. In the early layers of our network, we want to preserve as much information about the original input volume so that we can extract those low level features.
* input size and output size are same.


### Max Pooling
* It makes down-sampling or sub-sampling (Reduces the number of parameters)
* It makes the detection of features invariant to scale or orientation changes.
* It reduce the amount of parameters and computation in the network, and hence to also control overfitting.

## Implementing with Keras
### Create Model
* conv => max pool => dropout => conv => max pool => dropout => fully connected (2 layer)
* Dropout: Dropout is a technique where randomly selected neurons are ignored during training

# 
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix
import itertools

from keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical # convert to one-hot-encoding
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPool2D
from keras.optimizers import RMSprop,Adam
from keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau

model = Sequential()
#
model.add(Conv2D(filters = 8, kernel_size = (5,5),padding = 'Same', 
                 activation ='relu', input_shape = (28,28,1)))
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
#
model.add(Conv2D(filters = 16, kernel_size = (3,3),padding = 'Same', 
                 activation ='relu'))
model.add(MaxPool2D(pool_size=(2,2), strides=(2,2)))
model.add(Dropout(0.25))
# fully connected
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dense(256, activation = "relu"))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(10, activation = "softmax"))

### Define Optimizer   
* Adam optimizer: Change the learning rate
# Define the optimizer
optimizer = Adam(lr=0.001, beta_1=0.9, beta_2=0.999)

### Compile Model
# categorical crossentropy
# We make binary cross entropy at previous parts and in machine learning tutorial
# At this time we use categorical crossentropy. That means that we have multi class.

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer = optimizer , loss = "categorical_crossentropy", metrics=["accuracy"])

### Epochs and Batch Size
# Say you have a dataset of 10 examples (or samples). You have a **batch size** of 2, 
# and you've specified you want the algorithm to run for 3 **epochs**. 
# Therefore, in each epoch, you have 5 **batches** (10/2 = 5). Each batch gets passed through the algorithm, 
# therefore you have 5 iterations **per epoch**.


epochs = 10  # for better result increase the epochs
batch_size = 250

### Data Augmentation
* To avoid overfitting problem, we need to expand artificially our handwritten digit dataset
* Alter the training data with small transformations to reproduce the variations of digit.
* For example, the number is not centered The scale is not the same (some who write with big/small numbers) The image is rotated.


# data augmentation
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(
        featurewise_center=False,  # set input mean to 0 over the dataset
        samplewise_center=False,  # set each sample mean to 0
        featurewise_std_normalization=False,  # divide inputs by std of the dataset
        samplewise_std_normalization=False,  # divide each input by its std
        zca_whitening=False,  # dimesion reduction
        rotation_range=5,  # randomly rotate images in the range 5 degrees
        zoom_range = 0.1, # Randomly zoom image 10%
        width_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images horizontally 10%
        height_shift_range=0.1,  # randomly shift images vertically 10%
        horizontal_flip=False,  # randomly flip images
        vertical_flip=False)  # randomly flip images

datagen.fit(X_train)

# Fit the model
history = model.fit_generator(datagen.flow(X_train,Y_train, batch_size=batch_size),
                              epochs = epochs, validation_data = (X_val,Y_val), steps_per_epoch=X_train.shape[0] // batch_size)
                              
### Evaluate the model
* Test Loss visualization
* Confusion matrix


# Plot the loss and accuracy curves for training and validation 
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], color='b', label="validation loss")
plt.title("Test Loss")
plt.xlabel("Number of Epochs")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.legend()
plt.show()


# confusion matrix
import seaborn as sns
# Predict the values from the validation dataset
Y_pred = model.predict(X_val)
# Convert predictions classes to one hot vectors 
Y_pred_classes = np.argmax(Y_pred,axis = 1) 
# Convert validation observations to one hot vectors
Y_true = np.argmax(Y_val,axis = 1) 
# compute the confusion matrix
confusion_mtx = confusion_matrix(Y_true, Y_pred_classes) 
# plot the confusion matrix
f,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
sns.heatmap(confusion_mtx, annot=True, linewidths=0.01,cmap="Greens",linecolor="gray", fmt= '.1f',ax=ax)
plt.xlabel("Predicted Label")
plt.ylabel("True Label")
